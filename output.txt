Abstract
In the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential election campaign, social media platforms were increasingly used as 
direct sources of news, bypassing the editorial media. With the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’ millions of followers, 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>  has  become  a  platform  for  mass  communication  and  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s  main  online 
information channel. Likewise, social media has provided a platform for debating and critiquing 
the mainstream media by the campaigns and their networks. This article discusses the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> 
strategies of the democratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">republican</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> 
during  their  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a>  2016  presidential  election  campaigns.  While  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>  campaign’s  strategy 
confirms theories regarding the professionalisation of election campaigns, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign’s 
more amateurish yet authentic style in social media points towards de-professionalisation and 
even amateurism as a counter-trend in political communication.

Introduction
Social media is the latest fascination of political communication strategists, particularly 
during election campaigns. While television and newspapers remain dominant sources of 
news in general, social media has become an increasingly important source for political 
news in particular. In the 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential election cycle, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>

Barack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> as its icon, the social media political campaign became a buzzword of 
sorts, and the potential of social media to mobilise voters was thoroughly hyped as well.
Since then, social media has developed and grown in scale and scope – new platforms 
and services have emerged, and established platforms have expanded. These platforms 
have replaced campaign websites as the parties’ and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’ main online information 
channels. Yet there is no evidence that social media has replaced traditional channels for 
political  communication  –  TV  debates,  advertising,  rallies,  door  knocking,  the  news 
media and press conferences are still highly prioritised by the campaigns and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">can-
didate</a>s  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_G">Craig</a>,  2016;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Holdings">Nielsen</a>,  2012). Yet,  all  of  these  activities  are  now  impacted  in 
some way by social media – documented, debated and mentioned on <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> 
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a> by the campaigns and those who follow them.

The research literature on social media and election campaigns can be divided into 
three main strands. The first strand is concerned with the historical development of digi-
tal campaigns and the use of blogs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> to mobilise voters 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Bruns_(scholar)">Bruns</a>  and  Highfield,  2016;  Howard,  2006;  Kreiss,  2012;  Stromer-Galley,  2014). 
According to these studies, blogs were included in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> election campaigns starting in 
2004, but it was the 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> campaign that represented the first ‘social media elec-
tion’. The  second  strand  looks  at  the  level  of  interaction  with  voters  in  social  media 
campaigns  (<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a>  and  Naper,  2016;  Graham  et  al.,  2013;  Jackson  and  Lilleker,  2011; 
Stromer-Galley, 2000, 2004). A key finding in these studies is that politicians are reluc-
tant to engage in dialogue with voters on social media and that campaigns use social 
media primarily as an arena for political marketing. The third strand of research deals 
with the level of professionalisation of campaigns (Kreiss, 2014; Kreiss and Jasinski, 
2016; Lilleker and Negrine, 2002; Stromer-Galley, 2014).

Contributing to these three strands of research, this article asks the following: What 
are the most recent developments in social media election campaigns in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> 
and to what degree do these developments point in the direction of increased interaction 
with voters and/or increased professionalisation of the campaigns?

These research questions will be answered through an analysis of tweets posted on the 
official <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> accounts of the democratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">republican</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">can-
didate</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> 2016 presidential election cycle.1 In addition, the 
discussion will draw on insights from recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> election campaigns.

The article is divided into three main parts. The first looks at the recent developments 
in the election campaigns’ use of social media, the second deals more specifically with 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’ interactions with voters and the third addresses the level of professionali-
sation in the campaigns.

Recent developments in social media campaigns
In  order  to  discuss  recent  changes  in  the  social  media  and  technology-driven  election 
campaigns, it is useful to take a step back and discuss the development of political com-
munication prior to the current phase. It is nearly two decades since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Blumler">Blumler</a> and Kavanagh 
(1999) divided political communication in Western democracies into three distinct histori-
cal phases, starting with the two decades following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a> and what has been called 
the ‘golden age of the parties’ – that is, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a>-dominated communication system. The 

52 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a>_Journal_of_Communication"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a>_Journal_of_Communication"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Communication">Journal of Communication</a></a> 32</a>(1) 

second phase, starting in the 1960s, was the ‘era of television’. The third, more generally 
termed the digital era, is characterised by an intensified personalisation of political advo-
cacy and increased anti-elitism, popularisation and populism.

The  recent  developments  in  in  social  media  campaigns  connectes  well  with  these 
characteristics, and it is not difficult to find examples of personalisation, anti-elitism or 
populism in political communication on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a>. Yet, the term 
‘digital era’ also covers up the current trends in political communication, and I will thus 
tentatively suggest that, from the 2010s onwards, a forth phase is emerging: the ‘era of 
social media’, which represents a new shift in the power balance between politicians and 
editorial media; as a direct channel to the voters, social media returns us to the ‘golden 
age of the parties’, as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Blumler">Blumler</a> and Kavanagh (1999), except that this time 
around, the parties have been replaced by the campaigns.

The ‘era of social media’ does however not imply that platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a> has replaced television (or newspapers or radio, for that matter) 
but  it  has  changed  it  and  the  way  audiences  watch  it  (Chadwick  2014;  <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a>  and 
Syvertsen, 2016). TV is no longer a stand-alone medium for political communication, 
because its mainstream media presence currently exists in tandem with social media, 
in the context of both multi-platform campaigns and multi-tasking users. This means 
that politicians are inceasingly required to have a ‘performative flexibility’ in the inter-
ests of connecting with voters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_G">Craig</a>, 2016), moving comfortably between different 
format criteria and expectations, from the formal to the informal, from the profession-
alised to the personalised. This ups the threshold for political <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’ communica-
tive skills and presents the need for a professional yet highly flexible communication 
division within their campaigns.

Between the 2008 and 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential election cycle, social media has changed 
and become more various and omnipresent. In 2008, both the democratic and the repub-
lican campaigns used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">Myspace</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">Flickr</a>. By 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> had 
increased its user base significantly, and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> had emerged as the new social media 
network with a critical mass of devotees. In the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential election cycle, the 
democratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> campaign used far more social media platforms (nine) than the repub-
lican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Romney</a> campaign (five). The 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential election cycle saw a drop in the 
total  number  of  social  media  platforms;  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  campaigns  both  used 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign also used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest">Pinterest</a> 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center">Pew Research</a>, 2016).2 In the past decade or so, then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> campaigns have seen a period 
of expansion and experimentation, then a period of consolidation around the most wide-
spread social media platforms.

A  key  development  between  the  2012  and  the  2016  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a>  presidential  election  cam-
paigns is that the focus on images and videos has grown. This is especially evident in the 
ascent of the online mobile photo-sharing platform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a>, which was used by the 
aforementioned  campaigns  as  well  as  that  of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Bernie  Sanders</a>  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center">Pew  Research</a>,  2016). 
Moreover,  the  use  of  video  on  social  media  platforms  such  as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>  and  <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> 
increased significantly since the 2012 election cycle; the 2016 Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign, 
in  particular,  regularly  posted  videos  as  part  of  their  social  media  messages.  In  sum, 
social media has become a more prominent communication channel for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> campaigns 
since 2008, particularly in relation to campaign websites. In addition, in 2016, social 

<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a> 

53

media platforms are increasingly used as direct sources of news, bypassing the editorial 
media (Pew Report, 2016).

Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> for example launched her presidential candidacy by tweeting: ‘I’m 
running for president. Everyday <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</a>s need a champion, and I want to be that cham-
pion. – H’ (tweet, 12 April 2015). Rather than initiating a press conference and relying 
on the mainstream media to share her news, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s campaign staff chose <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>, in 
tandem with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a> video release titled ‘Getting started’,3 in which Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> 
tells us that she is ‘getting ready to run for president’.

Likewise, social media provided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> with a platform to critique the main-
stream media as biased and untrustworthy. In addition to several other established media 
companies, the New <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">York</a> Times was subjected to harsh judgment:

The  failing  @nytimes  is  truly  one  of  the  worst  newspapers. They  knowingly  write  lies  and 
never call to fact check. Really bad people! (Tweet, 13 March 2016)

Even though the numbers are not directly comparable, it is worth noting that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> 
had 17.6 million followers on <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and the New <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">York</a> Times has 1.2 million online-
only subscribers in the last quarter of 2016.4 In turn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> campaign might 
critique the mainstream media, but is also in itself a mass media channel. Social media is 
contributing to a shift in the power relation between the politcians and their campaigns 
and the mainstream media and the journalists, becauce the politicians now have a access 
to the means of production as well as efficient and direct distribution channels. These 
distribution channels differ from broadcasting and newspapers also in their interactive 
potential, which is a crucial factor to discuss as new trends in political communication.

Controlling the message
Historically, every new media technology seems to have brought with it a set of expecta-
tions related to the revival of democracy and the empowerment of the people in relation 
to the power elites (Barber, 1998; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yochai_Benkler">Benkler</a>, 2006; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht">Brecht</a>, 1983 [1930]). These idealistic 
expectations have often led to disappointment, as new media revert to the reinforcement 
of existing power hierarchies.

This disappointment is also found by those who study social media in political com-
munication;  at  various  stages  in  the  development  and  in  various  national  contexts, 
researchers have documented profound reluctance among politicians regarding enhanced 
interactivity with voters. Rather than using social media as a way to interact with voters 
or encourage dialogue which might empower the citizens, the political campaigns pri-
marily use social media as a channel for political marketing. As pinpointed by Jennifer 
Stromer-Galley (2000, 2014) in several studies over the course of more than a decade, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> campaigns do not prioritise dialogue and interactivity. In one of the more recent stud-
ies, she noted that: ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center">Campaigns</a> wish to mobilize the public in the service of the cam-
paign, but getting too close to them, really listening and empowering them, is dangerous 
and  at  least  disadvantageous’  (Stromer-Galley,  2014:  187).  Politicians’  reluctance  to 
engage in dialogue is also uncovered by studies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> political campaigns; in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, for example, online campaigns and social media usage were found to 

54 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a>_Journal_of_Communication"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a>_Journal_of_Communication"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Communication">Journal of Communication</a></a> 32</a>(1) 

simply replicate the one-way communication pattern established by mass media cam-
paigning (Coleman, 2001; Jackson and Lilleker, 2011).

In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n countries, the picture is more mixed; studies have demonstrated 
both a reluctance to interact with citizens using social media (Larsson and Moe, 2013) 
and the opposite inclination – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg">prime minister</a>, Erna <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg">Solberg</a>, for example, 
has  frequently  traded  tweets  with  journalists  as  well  as  citizens  (Larsson  and  Ihlen, 
2015). This willingness to engage in dialogue with voters, however, brings with it a cost, 
in the form of reduced control over one’s message and a greater risk of making a mistake. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg">Solberg</a> experienced the latter when she was mocked by one of her followers for a couple 
of spelling mistakes in her tweets. Even this worked out in the end, however: she politely 
explained  that  she  suffers  from  dyslexia,  and  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norwegian</a>  <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>sphere  promptly 
voiced its support for her candour and accessibility. This episode perhaps demonstrates 
less political reluctance to engage in dialogue with voters in egalitarian societies like 
those  in  the  Nordic  region  than  in  more  polarised  societies  like  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United  States</a>. 
Moreover, the epsiode pinpoints the advatages of being regarded as authentic, and the 
potential power of networked support from users (<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a> 2015).

In the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> election campaigns, familiar patterns from previous cycles reappeared, 
including a tendency towards one-way communication and little sign of voter–campaign 
interactivity. In fact, it would appear that the opportunities for public participation in digi-
tal political campaigns have decreased between 2012 and 2016. While the official cam-
paign websites of recent election cycles firmly controlled the message and any resultant 
public  participation,  2016  campaign  websites  lacked  comment  sections  altogether.  In 
addition, the campaigns clearly used social media platforms as channels to promote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">can-
didate</a>s and mobilise voters, not to engage with the public (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center">Pew Research</a>, 2016).

Retweeting or directly reposting content already posted by another user is a more pas-
sive and less demanding form of engaging with users on social media. Comparing the 
two main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s in the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> campaigns, the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign retweeted 
more frequently (about a quarter of his tweets were retweets) and engaged most exten-
sively with the general public (78% of the retweets were written by ordinary users). In 
comparison, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign retweeted considerably less frequently (only 15% of 
her tweets were retweets), and the messages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> retweeted were not posted by the 
general  public  but  by  her  team’s  related  campaign  accounts  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center">Pew  Research</a>  2016). 
Consequently, the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> strategies of the two presidential campaigns diverged – the 
2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign was more willing to engage with the general public and thus also 
to take the risk of retweeting content it did not control, whereas the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> cam-
paign was more guarded and geared towards total control over the message.

Professionalisation meets amateurism
The divergent <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> strategies around user engagement of the two campaigns in the 
2016  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a>  election  point  to  a  fundamental  difference  between  professionalisation  and 
amateurism in the social media strategies of the two campaigns. The 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> cam-
paign’s social media activity confirms theories regarding the professionalisation of elec-
tion campaigns in Western liberal democracies, while the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign has a 
more amateurish yet authentic style in social media.

Following the 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> presidential run, social media campaigns were no longer 
an  amateur  activity  –  technical  expertise,  focus  group  research  and  specialisation  of 
staffing  all  contributed  to  what  was  an  international  trend.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a>  political  parties 
were eager to study the strategies used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> effort, and social media expertise was 
exported from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> countries such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United 
Kingdom</a> to help political campaigns there to exploit the marketing potential of social 
media. The largest political <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">Labour Party</a>, visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> 2008 cam-
paign staffers for training and skill development regarding social media (Karlsen, 2013). 
Likewise,  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>  Conservative  Party  hired  the  2012  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Messina_(political_staffer)">campaign  manager</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Messina_(political_staffer)">Jim 
Messina</a> before the 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</a> election to ‘bring to their operation the same binding 
marriage  of  social  media  and  political  organization  that  many  in  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a>  credit  with 
securing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Mr.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> a second term’ (Stratton, 2013).5 The export of expertise contrib-
uted to a higher emphasis on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a>, also in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a>-centred 
political systems like in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</a> (<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a> and <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Skogerbø">Skogerbø</a>, 2013). As 
with the arrival of earlier technologies to the realm of political marketing, such as radio 
or TV, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> represented the international spearhead regarding the accompa-
nying 
towards  professionalisation  of  campaigning  (Maarek,  2011). 
Professionalisation of social media in election campaign is mainly found in the form of 
increasing standardisation of messages for the purpose of efficiently promoting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">can-
didate</a>, and research-based and advanced methods for mobilising voters (Kreiss, 2014; 
Stromer-Galley,  2014). As  such,  the  new  opportunities  offered  by  digital  technology 
results in an increasing professionalisation of election campaigns.

tendency 

However, there is also a counter-trend to professionalisation: de-professionalisation 
and even amateurism. This trend was for example seen in the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign, 
where the focus group tested tweeting seems to be replaced by a more gut-feeling tweet-
ing.  The  appeal  of  the  de-professionalised  campaign  was  to  a  degree  also  already 
acknowledged by the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> campaign, which explicitly sought alternatives to the 
professional staffer and consulting model and worked to de-professionalise its own staff 
(Kreiss  and  Jasinski,  2016:  15).  It  would  appear,  then,  that  there  are  benefits  to  both 
approaches to social media, depending on the context, targeted audience and goal.

The 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign represented a continuation of the professionalised social 
media  campaigns  established  in  previous  presidential  campaigns  by  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a>_Party_(United_States)"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a> 
Party</a>  –  technological  expertise  and  digital  communication  structure,  after  all,  tend  to 
transfer  from  one  cycle  to  the  next  (Kreiss  and  Jasinski,  2016).  In  contrast,  the  2016 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  campaign  started  from  scratch  in  the  realm  of  political  communication;  while 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> was already a savvy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">exploiter</a> of the media as both a celebrity and a busi-
ness owner, he had never been involved in a political election campaign. In light of the 
theory of an increasing professionalisation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</a> election campaigns, then, the 
2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign represented a counter-trend.

Rather than copying the social media strategies of the professionalised campaigns run 
by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> chose a strategy better described as amateurism. 
Its amateurism did not derive from any lack of strategy or competence about basic media 
logics, however, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> knew how to get media coverage, validating those stud-
ies that have demonstrated that celebrity politicians are several times more likely than 
unknown politicians to be quoted in the mainstream news on the basis of their social

media posts (Chadwick, 2014; Wallsten, 2013). His celebrity status therefore fuelled the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign and enabled a strategy based on a controversial and unexpected use of 
social media, and in particular, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a>. His image as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> was largely formed by 
his widely circulated tweets, which were often quoted and debated in the mainstream 
media.

The controlled politician versus the authentic outsider
In order to analyse these two divergent strategies more closely, I compared the tweeting 
styles of Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> in terms of professionalism versus amateur-
ism. Figure 1 presents the results of a quantitative comparison based on the coding of 
tweets as either traditional, meaning professionalised and in line with the established 
standards for tweets posted by a presidential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>, or non-traditional, meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">ama-
teur</a>ish, in the sense that they do not follow the standards.

The comparison clearly demonstrates the contrast between the 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign 
and  the  2016  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>  campaign  in  terms  of  standardisation  and  professionalisation. 
While 82% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s tweets are categorised as traditional, only 38% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s tweets 
are in line with established stylistic standards. Likewise, almost 55% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s tweets 
were unconventional, as opposed to only 13% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s tweets.

Again, this is not to say that this kind of amateurishness is ineffective or inferior as 
strategic communication. There is a rhetorical strength in this voice that responds to the 
ideal of authenticity of the speaker (<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a>, 2015). By not even attempting the guise of 
professionalism using digital media staffers or communication experts, that is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a> made a statement regarding his positioning as a genuine outsider.

Probably motivated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign’s unconventional style, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> cam-
paign also posted some tweets with unexpected and informal content. A key example of 
this was the tweet ‘Delete your account’ (tweet, 09 June 2016), sent as a reply to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s 
tweet: ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> but 
nobody else does!’ (tweet, 09 June 2016). This response was surprising, given the more 
formal  and  polite  messages  that  were  regularly  posted  to  her  account,  and  the  tweet 

<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a> 

57

gained enormous attention and was retweeted more than 500,000 times. The expression 
‘delete your account’ is a standard ironic tweet used as a response to tweets, usually by 
politicians, which are inappropriate or out of touch with the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> community.

Moreover, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign quickly picked up on new trends such as gamifica-
tion,  meaning  the  use  of  gaming  elements  and  game  structures  in  new  contexts.  To 
encourage voter registration, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign associated it with the 
location-based  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Go">augmented  reality  game</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Go">Pokemon  Go</a>  only  a  week  after  the  game’s 
launch.6 In a context of professionalisation, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign used social media to 
re-brand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> as trendier than she typically appears in mass media coverage (see 
Parry-Giles, 2014).

One communicative challenge for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presidential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s is that their social media 
accounts  appear  personal  but  are  usually  overseen  by  campaign  staffers.  In  the  case  of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s campaign, then, it might have been confusing for voters to meet such a digitally 
savvy and tech-trendy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> who was inviting users to play online games or respond 
with emojis. Even when users are well aware of the fact that political advisers and media 
staffers are administering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> accounts, the image presented on social 
media might be simply too distant from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s general image to be compelling or 
believable. Accordingly, a key dilemma for the campaigns is to identify the right balance 
between the general image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s social media persona.

This  dilemma  was  much  less  relevant  to  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  campaign  than  to  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> 
campaign. First of all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> simply stayed more involved in his staff’s tweeting and 
even  wrote  many  of  his  own  tweets. According  to  news  interviews, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  generally 
wrote the tweets himself after 7:00 p.m. at night, and during the day he dictated them by 
shouting words and even punctuation marks at his staffers.7 The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s personal 
involvement was also underlined by the account name @real_Donald<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>, as though 
to underline that the tweets came directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> himself and were not managed and 
crafted solely by his campaign.

In comparison, Barack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> did not write any of his social media messages during 
the 2008 election campaign, and only 1% of the Tweets posted during the 2012 cycle 
were signed ‘b.o.’, the clue that they were in fact authored by the president (<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_Enli">Enli</a> and 
Naper, 2016). A similar strategy was used by Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>, who used the ‘ – H’ signa-
ture to indicate that a tweet was written by her. This signature was typically used quite 
seldom and selectively; it for example appeared in the tweet announcing her candidacy, 
but not in tweets criticising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>. Consequently, the tweets posted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s account 
came across as less spontaneous and genuine compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s tweets . . .

A comparative study of the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> campaign and the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Romney</a> campaign 
demonstrates that the autonomy of digital media staffers was considerably higher in the 
former, and that they could post messages and updates without always consulting with 
the political side of the organisation (Kreiss, 2014). The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> delegated much 
less social media work to professionals than either of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama</a> campaigns and the 2016 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> campaign meant that his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> image on social media was much closer to his 
self-presentation.  To  a  degree,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  therefore  came  across  as  more  consistent  an 
authetic compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>, and image that was strenghtened by his position as a new-
comer  in  politics.  This  image  of  the  outspoken  outsider  was  constructed  through  a 
dynamic between the mass media and social media.

A closer examination of the tweets posted on @real_Donald<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> demonstrates that 
more than one-third of the tweets included ‘authenticity markers’, in the sense that they 
expressed impoliteness and political incorrectness, often using capital letters. The fol-
lowing tweet, for example, incorporates name-calling, insults and stylistic devices such 
as all-caps and exclamation marks:

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> says, she has bad judgment. 
Constantly playing the women’s card – it is sad! (Tweet, 06 May 2016)

Capital letters are often used to emphasise one’s sincerity, spontaneity and engage-
ment, offering the speaker an air of authenticity. In these regards, then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>’s tweets 
were fairly predictable, and his voice was very recognisable to his followers. Even in 
tweets with a political message that reference specific numbers or make promises, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign used capital letters and exclamation marks as markers of an ‘authentic 
outsider’:

North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</a> lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE W<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">IL</a>L BRING BACK! (Tweet, 15 March 2016)

In comparison, only 5% of the selected tweets posted on Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>’s account 
included ‘authenticity markers’, meaning elements displaying a kind of backstage or a 
passionate side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>. Confirming her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> image etablished in televised 
debates and public rallies, a typical tweet posted by the campaign Hillary for America 
(HFA) was crafted and policy-oriented:

Our families and workplaces have changed in the 21st century. It’s time for our policies – from 
paid leave to equal pay – to be updated too. (Tweet, 05 July 2016)

In light of the development of social media campaigns from 2008 onwards, which by 
scholars and commentators has been described as a process of professionalisation, the 
2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign represent a relatively unexpected turn away from the norm for 
political  communication  on  social  media.  The  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>  campaign  was  extraordinary  in 
many ways, including the rhetoric, the rallies, the groundgame, the mainstream media, 
and, as we have seen in this article, the social media strategy. Compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> 
campaign’s innovative use of digital media, extensive use of staffers, and the democratic 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>)">party</a>’s expertise, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a> campaign seemed pretty amateurish. Yet, ‘amateur’ might 
strenghten the image of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> as authentic; the term ‘amateur’ refers to someone 
who  engages  in  an  activity  for  pleasure  and  not  as  a  paid  job.  Politicians  who  come 
across as too professional might therefore seem calculated and cynical, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">ama-
teur</a> has the benefit of perhaps seeming clumsy and imperfect, but yet authentic.

Conclusion
Since the mid-1970s, a growing strand of research has argued that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s image is

2009; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Westen">Westen</a>, 2008). Social media represents a new means of constructing and negotiat-
ing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s image, and campaigns’ social media strategies are important sources of 
information and perspective on a given year’s election.

This article discussed social media use in the 2016 election campaigns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> presi-
dential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s Hillary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a>, in order to explore recent develop-
ments  in  relation  to  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>s’  degree  of  interaction  with  voters  and  tendencies 
towards professionalisation. Three main findings stood out.

First, the election campaigns used social media primarily as a marketing tool, and the 
reluctance concerning online exchanges with voters that characterised previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> pres-
idential election campaigns was very present in the 2016 election cycle. Even the candi-
date who broke all the rules, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>">Donald <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></a>, kept his social media followers at arm’s 
length and limited his engagement to retweeting selected tweets. The need to control the 
message and promote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> overwhelmed any campaign interest in initiating an 
open and enlightened public debate.

Second, social media election campaigns are constantly developing, and in the current 
phase of political communication professionalisation is challenged by amateurism. The 
technological  infrastructure  for  networked  communication  is  exploited  differently  by 
various campaigns in various political cultures. There are clear signs of professionalisa-
tion  in  social  media  campaigns,  and  in  particular,  the  2016  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a>  campaign  clearly 
inherits  the  tendency  in  this  regard  of  previous  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a>  campaigns.  However,  the 
2016 social media election cycle was also marked by amateurism, either as a calculated 
strategy or the result of a spontaneous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> (or both). In any case, it has become 
clear that the amateur has a rhetorical claim to authenticity that manages to compete with 
the professionalism of a more polished or controlled campaign. From a political culture 
that  is  very  different  from  the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a>  presidential  elections,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norwegian</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg">Prime  Minister</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg">Solberg</a> combines professionalism and amateurism on her social media sites and thus 
comes across as more accessible than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</a> but more composed than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>.

Third, social media platforms might have an agenda-setting impact and constitute a 
powerful  arena  for  constructing  and  maintaining  a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s  image.  This  effect  is 
dependent on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a>’s capital, in the form of either celebrity status or economic 
resources,  because  these  advantages  will  in  turn  attract  coverage  in  the  mainstream 
media. Yet it must be said that without <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> or an equivalent social media platform, it 
would have been difficult for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">candidate</a></a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>, who lacked political experience 
and a support structure within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican Party</a>, to come across as viable. Social 
media represents an opportunity for both political outsiders and media campaign <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">ama-
teur</a>s to succeed even as it disrupts the comfort zones of established politicians and their 
professionalised campaigns.
